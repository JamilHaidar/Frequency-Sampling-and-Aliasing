# Frequency-Sampling-and-Aliasing
A visual demo showing how sampling frequency and phase shift affect the read signal.

I wrote this when taking the Signals and Systems course in order to visualize the Nyquist Frequency rule and how sampling works.
This was a quick project purely for my own understanding.

I use the ACM library which is deprecated now. It also uses Applet which is no longer availabe in current Java versions.
